# Project Title:
  The Art's of Post Processing Algorithms on Android 
  
# About:
This application was purely built for research purposes to get a general understanding of image processing on Android smartphones as well as understanding the technicality behind the algorithm which develops and enhances an image from the camera sensor.

# Application Name:
Vision X
  
# Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

# Prerequisites:
Android Studio IDE
An Android device Running android 7.0
OpenCV Module Android Package (free-downloadable at https://opencv.org/)
Developer Options enabled on your device with USB  debuggin enabled
ADB installed installed onto the PC (if you chose to install the application via USB cable)

# Running the code (secure method):
Downloaded and install the OpenCV module onto Android Studio. There are various methods online to help with this.
Create a new android studio project.
Download all the files in project repositories and replace the your project files with the downloaded repositories files.
To test and run the application you can either build an apk out of the code (longer but easier) or you can run 
the application throuhg ADB via USB connection between your phone and the PC. 

Built With Android Studio, Eclipse (debugging and testing only) and the OpenCV framework

This version of the application is Vision X 1.0
